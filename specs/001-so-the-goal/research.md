# Research: Free Python Library for Translation

**Date**: 2025-10-12

## Decision

We will use the `googletrans` library for translating text to English.

## Rationale

-   It is a free and unlimited Python library.
-   It uses the Google Translate API.
-   It supports auto language detection and bulk translations.

## Alternatives Considered

-   `deep_translator`: Another good option, but `googletrans` is more popular and has better documentation.
-   `translate`: Supports multiple translation providers, but can be more complex to set up.
