# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

The project aims to create a vector database of cruise information. The data will be extracted from a Postgres materialized view, transformed into a semantic format, and then loaded into a Chroma vector database. The system will also provide a FastAPI endpoint to query the vector database.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Python 3.11
**Primary Dependencies**:
- `psycopg2-binary` for Postgres connection
- `fastapi` for the API
- `uvicorn` for running the API
- `chromadb` for the vector database
- `beautifulsoup4` for HTML tag removal
- `googletrans` for translation
**Storage**: PostgreSQL, Chroma DB
**Testing**: `pytest`
**Target Platform**: Linux server
**Project Type**: Single project
**Performance Goals**: Not applicable
**Constraints**: The system must handle different localizations and translate them to English.
**Scale/Scope**: The system should be able to handle a large number of cruises.

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- **I. Secure Credential Management**: All database credentials MUST be stored in environment variables.

**Structure Decision**: The project will follow a single project structure, with distinct modules for data extraction, transformation, vector database management, and the API.

## Complexity Tracking

*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
