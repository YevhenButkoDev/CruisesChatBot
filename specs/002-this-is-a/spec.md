**Feature Branch**: `002-this-is-a`
**Created**: 2025-10-16
**Status**: Draft

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Find a Cruise with Specific Dates (Priority: P1)

A potential customer, Alex, wants to find a cruise vacation. Alex interacts with the chatbot to get recommendations based on a specific destination and time of year.

**Why this priority**: This is the core functionality of the feature and provides the primary value to the user.

**Independent Test**: This can be tested by a user starting a conversation with the chatbot, providing a destination and date range, and verifying that relevant cruise options are returned.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1.  **Given** Alex has started a conversation with the chatbot, **When** Alex expresses intent to find a cruise, **Then** the chatbot should ask for a destination.
2.  **Given** the chatbot has asked for a destination, **When** Alex provides a destination (e.g., "the Caribbean"), **Then** the chatbot should ask for a date range.
3.  **Given** the chatbot has asked for a date range, **When** Alex provides a date range (e.g., "next summer"), **Then** the chatbot should return a list of matching cruise options.

### User Story 2 - Find a Cruise with Flexible Dates (Priority: P2)

A potential customer, Sam, is flexible on travel dates and wants to explore cruise options for a specific destination.

**Why this priority**: This handles a common user scenario and increases the flexibility of the search feature.

**Independent Test**: This can be tested by a user providing a destination and indicating that the travel dates are not important, then verifying that the chatbot returns cruises for the next calendar year.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1.  **Given** the chatbot has asked for a date range, **When** Sam indicates that the date is not important, **Then** the chatbot should search for cruises in the next calendar year.
2.  **Given** Sam has indicated flexible dates, **When** the chatbot searches for cruises, **Then** it should return a list of matching cruise options for the next year.

### User Story 3 - Ask a General Question (Priority: P3)

A user, Taylor, has a general question about cruises and uses the chatbot to get a quick answer.

**Why this priority**: This provides additional value to the user by making the chatbot a general source of information, not just a search tool.

**Independent Test**: This can be tested by a user asking a factual question (e.g., "What is the luggage allowance?") and verifying that the chatbot provides a correct answer.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1.  **Given** Taylor has started a conversation, **When** Taylor asks a general question about cruises, **Then** the chatbot should provide a direct and accurate answer.

### Edge Cases

-   What happens when a user provides a destination for which there are no available cruises? The chatbot should inform the user that no cruises were found and suggest trying a different destination.
-   How does the system handle ambiguous user input, such as a misspelled destination or an unclear date range? The chatbot should ask for clarification.
-   What happens if the underlying cruise information database is unavailable? The chatbot should inform the user that it is currently unable to search for cruises and to try again later.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

-   **FR-001**: The system MUST provide an API for the chatbot to handle user conversations.
-   **FR-002**: The API MUST enable the chatbot to identify the user's intent (e.g., finding a cruise vs. asking a general question).
-   **FR-003**: If the user's intent is to find a cruise, the API MUST guide the user to provide a destination and a date range.
-   **FR-004**: The API MUST handle cases where the user does not specify a date range by defaulting the search to the next calendar year.
-   **FR-005**: The API MUST query a cruise information database to find cruises matching the user's criteria.
-   **FR-006**: The API MUST return a list of relevant cruise options to the chatbot.
-   **FR-007**: The API MUST be able to provide answers to general, non-search-related questions about cruises.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

-   **Cruise**: Represents a cruise vacation, including attributes such as destination, itinerary, sailing dates, ship information, and pricing.
-   **UserIntent**: Represents the user's goal, such as `find_cruise` or `ask_general_question`.
-   **Conversation**: Represents the ongoing dialogue between the user and the chatbot, including all messages exchanged.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

-   **SC-001**: The chatbot successfully guides a user through the cruise search flow (from intent to results) in over 90% of interactions.
-   **SC-002**: The system returns cruise recommendations within 3 seconds of the user providing all necessary information (destination and dates).
-   **SC-003**: The chatbot correctly identifies the user's intent from the initial message in at least 95% of conversations.
-   **SC-004**: User satisfaction with the chatbot, measured by an optional post-interaction survey, achieves an average score of at least 4 out of 5.

## Out of Scope

- The user interface (UI) for the chatbot.
- The creation and population of the cruise information vector database.
- User authentication or account management.
- The process of booking a cruise.
