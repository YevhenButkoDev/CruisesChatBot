# Implementation Plan: AI Chatbot for Cruise Search

**Feature Branch**: `002-this-is-a`
**Feature Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Created**: 2025-10-16
**Status**: In Progress

## Technical Context

-   **Technology Stack**: The project is built on Python 3.11, using FastAPI as the web framework and ChromaDB as the vector database, and langchain as a main sceleton for model + vector db + session management and chat history aggregation.
-   **Dependencies**: Key dependencies include `fastapi`, `uvicorn`, `chromadb`, and `python-dotenv`. The full list is in `requirements.txt`.
-   **Existing Codebase**: The `src` directory contains the main application logic. An existing `api.py` provides a basic FastAPI application with a `/query` endpoint for searching the ChromaDB. The `vector_db` module handles the interaction with ChromaDB.
-   **Integration Points**: The primary integration will be expanding the existing FastAPI to handle the conversational flow of the chatbot. This will involve more sophisticated interaction with the ChromaDB than the current simple query endpoint.

## Constitution Check

-   **I. Secure Credential Management**: All credentials, API keys, and other secrets MUST be stored in environment variables. The use of `python-dotenv` in `requirements.txt` suggests this is already being handled correctly. All new code will adhere to this principle.

## Gates

All gates pass. The plan is consistent with the feature specification and the project's constitution.

## Phase 0: Outline & Research

No research is required for this feature. The technology stack is well-defined, and the implementation path is clear. A `research.md` file will not be created.

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts

### Data Model

The data model will be based on the entities defined in the feature specification.

**(This will be generated in `data-model.md`)**

### API Contract

The API will be defined in an OpenAPI 3.0 specification. It will expand on the existing `api.py` to include endpoints for managing a conversation and getting cruise recommendations.

**(This will be generated in `contracts/openapi.yaml`)**

### Quickstart

A `quickstart.md` will be created to provide instructions on how to set up and run the new chatbot API.

**(This will be generated in `quickstart.md`)**

## Phase 2: Implementation Tasks

(This will be filled in a later step)
